# TextSummarizer
A textRank based summarizer heavily inspired by Matt Gallivans keynote at Edmonton py: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2RBih6Cm0
The code shown in the keynote is not complete, so I rewrote and added some parts to make the summarizer work. Did not find a Fork
on Github, please notify me if there is one so I can credit him in a proper way. 

# Dependencies:
